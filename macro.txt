At firt you create a macro file in the dir of ~/home/nihan/PlayOnLinux's virtual drives/Far_Manager/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Far Manager/Plugins/TrueTemplate/templates/file/file[this is macro file]
code like => freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);

second.

you go to the file of true-source-base.xml and you find Macros tab. in the first line of macro tab you add a macro name in the first line last like:
  <Expand Name="&amp;Macros "                                                               To="\~Date and time=Date and time\~Date=Date\~Time=Time\~file=file"/>
  here i use \~file=file this is my macro name.
and add this line as the last line of Macro Tab.

<Expand Name="file"                     At="&OutWord;" SubMenu="1" Pattern="file|file"      To="\i'$\templates\file\file'"/>
